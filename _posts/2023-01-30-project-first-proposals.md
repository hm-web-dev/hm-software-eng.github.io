# Project Proposal - 1st

You are going to be writing your project proposals, and they are due at the end of the week.
If you choose not to change your mind (we'll talk about when we can pivot shall we need to), you could be working on this project for the rest of the 2nd semester (as long as you have substantial work to complete).

## Task

Submit a document that answers the following questions.

1. What is your project idea?
2. What are your motivations for this idea?
3. What new computer science topics outside of what we've learned / going to learn will you need to learn to complete your project?
4. What do you need to code for your front-end application? (All projects need some front-end unless you get teacher permission otherwise!)
5. What do you need to code for a back-end application / storage? (All projects need some back-end)
6. What other ideas did you consider but didn't end up doing? (you can provide a link to a live collab)

## Project Deliverables

Once I have approved this first proposal, you are free to start working on your project. For this lab specifically, you will be building at least **3 endpoints** with your team dedicated to this project. We will be fleshing out our proposals significantly as we progress through the semester.
