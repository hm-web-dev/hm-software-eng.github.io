## Vue

[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) is a front-end web framework that allows you to create powerful web applications that allow you to write web UIs in a component-based, data-first way. That is, you can modularize repeatable code into components, and these components couple data manipulation methods with the HTML that user sees into single files.

This problem set allows you to practice:

- Coding multiple components in vue (in a MVVM framework)
- Passing data from parent to child components in props
- And listening to events made by the child component
- Creating a component hierarchy within a Vue application

## Exercise

Fork [vue-example](https://github.com/hm-software-eng/vue-example). Build the project, look around, familiar yourself with some components, and add onto this lovely website!

1. Add more hotdogs to the Home component! Your team needs 4 more things to "put on" the hotdog. The hotdog picture should change with each different click.

2. Build on the Testimonials component. Add a text and a heading.

    - Change the Navbar to point not to the 'testimonials.html' file, but directly to the Testimonials fragment via routing (a 'virtual' path)
    - Food for thought: What do our routes look like by this 'virtual' page splitting? Why do you think others might not use this routing strategy?

3. Create the Store vue component. It will be a parent component of a bunch of StoreItem components! Add this to the navbar routes! Also add it to the navbar.

4. A StoreItem component should have, at the very least, an image, a product name, a product description, and a price.
    - Create 4 StoreItems to list out, you can choose to display them in a grid or whichever way you like.

5. Extra: Set up an "Add Item" button for each Store Item and pass data to the parent (or grandparent, if you need) to actually add that item to the cart.

You should be using [Vue Browser Extensions](https://devtools.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html) to debug your app on the browser.

## Submission

Fork a github repo for your front-end app that has your team's changes and a `README.md` that answers the food for thought.
